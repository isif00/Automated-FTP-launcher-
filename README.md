# Automated FTP launcher
This script automates the process of setting up an FTP server using vsftpd and FileZilla.

# How to use
Simply run the script with administrative privileges using the command sudo python3 main.py. Fill in all the required information and wait for the script to complete its tasks.
At the end of the process, a FileZilla window will pop up. Enter your IP address and the user credentials that you created earlier.
If you wish to share FTP access with others, you need to perform 'port forwarding' for the specific port that you created. 
You can easily configure port forwarding in your router settings.
Please note that this script streamlines the setup process for you, making it convenient and efficient to launch your FTP server and manage access to it. 
If you encounter any issues or errors during the script execution, 
ensure that you have provided the correct information and double-check your network and router settings.
